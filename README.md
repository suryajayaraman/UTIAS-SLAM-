Scope of Repository
-------------------

1. Baseline EKF (inspired by Andrew Kramer's work)
2. Effect of models on filter performace
3. Comparing UKF and CKF
4. Workflow for KF (inspired by Sensor Fusion and Non linear filtering course on edX)


Reference
----------

1. Andrew Kramer's work
https://github.com/1988kramer/UTIAS-practice
Output of matlab script (localization/EKF_known_corr) is stored as test.dat which is used as baseline to improve upon.

2. Roger Labbe's work on KF is great place to learn
